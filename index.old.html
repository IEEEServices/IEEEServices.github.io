<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>
<b>IEEE Services Hackathon</b> is an event collocated with the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2020), and is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.
</p>

<p>
  The IEEE Computer Society established the services computing initiative two decades ago in response to the fast-growing service industry as well as the exponential rise in computing professionals.
</p>

<p>
At the IEEE Services Hackathon, we want services computing to feel relatable to students who are about to embark on their professional career, and show how services computing can be used to help people improve the quality of life. The Hackathon provides a platform for enthusiastic and driven students from a diverse range of backgrounds to collaborate and bring innovative ideas within the services computing industry to life, while providing them with an opportunity to engage with industry mentors.
</p>

<p>
As a team, you will have the opportunity to engage and collaborate with other students who come from different backgrounds, as well as be able to demonstrate and hone your programming, presentation and analytical skills. You will also be paired with a mentor. At the end of the Hackathon, you will also be provided with a certificate of participation.
</p>

<p>
We are also inviting young professionals to volunteer as mentors at this event. As a mentor, you will be assigned to a team to help them on their projects. Mentors must be available on the dates of the Hackathon.
</p>

<p>
We will be publishing details of the projects that you can participate in the near future so watch this space!
